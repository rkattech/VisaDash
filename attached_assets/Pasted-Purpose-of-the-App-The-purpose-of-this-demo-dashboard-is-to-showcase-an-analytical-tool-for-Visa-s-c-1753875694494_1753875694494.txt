Purpose of the App
The purpose of this demo dashboard is to showcase an analytical tool for Visa's cross-border business unit leadership. It will enable tracking progress toward a 10% CAGR in cross-border revenues (from $12.7 billion in FY2024 to approximately $22.5 billion by 2030) and identify growth opportunities. The demo will simulate real-time data visualization using mock or historical data, demonstrating interactivity, insights, and decision-support features.
Scope
	• In Scope: Implementation of all views described in the dashboard overview (Executive Summary, Performance Tracking, Opportunity Identification, Risk and Compliance, Forecasting). Include basic interactivity (filters, drill-downs, tooltips), mock data for FY2024-Q4 FY2025, and export options (e.g., PDF/CSV).
	• Out of Scope: Integration with live Visa data sources, advanced AI/ML forecasting models, mobile responsiveness, or production-level security. This is a proof-of-concept demo.
Functional Requirements
The dashboard must support the following features, organized by section. Each view should include filters for time period (e.g., quarterly, YTD), segment (consumer, B2B, remittances), geography, and product (e.g., Visa Direct, B2B Connect).

Data Requirements
Data Sources for Demo
	• Use mock datasets generated from historical Visa reports and expectations (e.g., Q3 FY2025 cross-border volume growth ~12.8%).
	• Mock Data Generation: Create CSV/JSON files with: 
		○ Time-series data: Quarterly revenue/volume from FY2024-Q4 FY2025.
		○ Segment breakdowns: Randomly generated within realistic ranges (e.g., travel volume: 10-20% growth).
		○ External benchmarks: Hard-coded from sources like FSB reports ($290T global flows by 2030).
	• Schema Example: 
		○ Table: Revenue_Trends (columns: Quarter, Revenue_B, Volume_Growth_Pct, Segment, Region).
		○ Table: KPIs (columns: Metric_Name, Target, Current_Value, YoY_Change).
		○ Total Records: 500-1,000 for demo performance.
	• Data Refresh: Static for demo; simulate real-time with a "Refresh" button reloading mock data.
UI Design Specifications
	• Layout: Single-page app with top navigation bar (sections as tabs), left sidebar for filters, main content area for visuals.
Color Scheme: Visa branding (blue #003087, green for positive growth, red for risks).
